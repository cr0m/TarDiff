# TarDiff
TarDiff is a Python-based tool that compares the contents of two tar files. It computes MD5 checksums and file sizes, identifies differences, and generates a detailed report. The tool features a user-friendly GUI for selecting tar files and specifying the output directory. The resulting report is automatically opened in Notepad++ for easy review.
